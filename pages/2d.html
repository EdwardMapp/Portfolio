		<p>Animated and edited on After Effects, “Space Ted” tells a simple story about how one man outsmarts an enemy base, shown through an interrogation done by the antagonist to the protagonist. This project is reflective of my love for sci-fi stories, as well as the various visual effects possibilities that come with it. My technical process involved storyboarding based on my script, designing and rigging the characters, and applying motion to the 2D assets based on the storyboards. After applying motion, much of the editing was focused on adding texture to the assets, visual effects, sound design, and color grading.</p>

		<br>
		<p>Animated and edited on After Effects, "Fatal Choice" is a piece where I strictly wanted to tell a story through visuals and experiment with how successful it can be done. The story is centered around a ghostly figure that must decide the inevitable fate of an entire world. While knowing of an inevitable star explosion, this powerful figure struggles between using its power to instantly wipe the planet from existence to spare it the pain, or allowing the planet to burn from the explosion of the star. It ultimately decides to wipe the planet out of existence after heavy reluctance, which I hoped to show through the body language of the character.</p>
